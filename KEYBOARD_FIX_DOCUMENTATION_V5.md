# Keyboard Fix v5.0 - Dynamic Bottom Padding Solution

## Problem Statement

In apps like schul.cloud, text fields positioned at the very bottom of a webpage cannot be scrolled into view when the keyboard appears because there's no more content below to scroll to. The previous solution (v4.2) focused on scrolling, which doesn't help in these edge cases.

## Solution Overview

Version 5.0 introduces a **two-pronged approach** that makes webapps scale to the space above the keyboard:

### 1. Dynamic Bottom Padding (Primary Fix)

When the keyboard appears, JavaScript dynamically adds bottom padding to the `<body>` element equal to the keyboard height plus a comfort zone. This:

- Creates scrollable space at the bottom of the page
- Allows bottom-positioned inputs to be scrolled into view
- Removes padding cleanly when keyboard hides

### 2. Viewport Height Adjustments (CSS Enhancement)

Uses modern CSS viewport units (`dvh` - dynamic viewport height) that automatically adjust when the keyboard appears:

- Containers using `100vh` get converted to `100dvh` when keyboard is visible
- Makes the page naturally resize to fit above the keyboard
- No JavaScript calculations needed for basic containers

## Implementation Details

### Changes in `InjectionScripts.ts`

#### CSS Enhancements

```css
/* Use dynamic viewport height units */
html {
  min-height: 100dvh !important;
  min-height: -webkit-fill-available !important;
  scroll-behavior: smooth !important;
}

body {
  min-height: 100dvh !important;
  min-height: -webkit-fill-available !important;
  transition: padding-bottom 0.2s ease-out !important;
}

/* Convert containers to use dynamic viewport when keyboard visible */
body.bbz-keyboard-visible [style*="height: 100vh"] {
  height: 100dvh !important;
}
```

#### JavaScript Logic

1. **Store Original Padding**

   ```javascript
   if (originalBodyPaddingBottom === null) {
     const computedStyle = window.getComputedStyle(document.body);
     originalBodyPaddingBottom = computedStyle.paddingBottom;
   }
   ```

2. **Apply Dynamic Padding on Keyboard Show**

   ```javascript
   if (heightDiff > CONFIG.KEYBOARD_MIN_HEIGHT) {
     isKeyboardVisible = true;
     keyboardHeight = heightDiff;

     // Apply dynamic bottom padding
     const paddingValue = keyboardHeight + CONFIG.BOTTOM_PADDING_EXTRA;
     document.body.style.paddingBottom = paddingValue + "px";
   }
   ```

3. **Restore Original Padding on Keyboard Hide**

   ```javascript
   if (isKeyboardVisible) {
     isKeyboardVisible = false;
     document.body.style.paddingBottom = originalBodyPaddingBottom || "";
   }
   ```

4. **Enhanced Bottom Detection**

   ```javascript
   const inputPagePosition = window.pageYOffset + rect.top;
   const isNearBottom = inputPagePosition / pageHeight > 0.8;

   if (isNearBottom) {
     debugLog("🎯 Input is near BOTTOM of page - Dynamic padding should help");
   }
   ```

## Key Features

### ✅ What Was Added

1. **Dynamic Bottom Padding**

   - Automatically calculated based on keyboard height
   - Extra 50px comfort zone (`BOTTOM_PADDING_EXTRA`)
   - Smooth transition (0.2s ease-out)
   - Properly restored when keyboard hides

2. **Viewport Height Units**

   - Uses `100dvh` (dynamic viewport height)
   - Webkit fallback with `-webkit-fill-available`
   - Automatic conversion of fixed `100vh` containers

3. **Bottom-of-Page Detection**

   - Identifies inputs in last 20% of page
   - Provides enhanced logging for debugging
   - Confirms padding is applied before scrolling

4. **Improved Timing**
   - Delays scroll by 150ms after keyboard detection to allow padding to apply
   - Reduced from 5 scroll attempts to 4 (cleaner)
   - Final scroll at 600ms after padding fully applied

### ❌ What Was NOT Included

1. **Content Scaling/Transform** - Avoided because:
   - Can break page layouts
   - May cause text to become too small
   - Risk of visual glitches
   - The padding solution is cleaner and safer

## Configuration

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  SCROLL_DELAY: 300, // Base delay before scrolling
  IMMEDIATE_SCROLL_DELAY: 100, // First immediate scroll
  DEBOUNCE_DELAY: 100, // Resize event debouncing
  KEYBOARD_MIN_HEIGHT: 150, // Minimum height to detect keyboard
  BOTTOM_PADDING_EXTRA: 50, // Extra padding beyond keyboard height
};
```

## How It Works: Step by Step

1. **User focuses on an input field at the bottom of the page**

   - JavaScript detects the focus event
   - Multiple scroll attempts begin immediately

2. **Keyboard starts to appear**

   - `visualViewport.resize` event fires
   - Height difference is calculated
   - If difference > 150px, keyboard is considered visible

3. **Dynamic padding is applied**

   - Original body padding is stored (if not already stored)
   - New padding = keyboard height + 50px extra
   - Body gets new padding with smooth transition
   - Class `bbz-keyboard-visible` is added to body

4. **Page content becomes scrollable**

   - The added padding creates scrollable space at bottom
   - Input field can now be scrolled into view
   - Scroll methods work normally with the new space

5. **User dismisses keyboard**
   - Viewport height returns to normal
   - Original padding is restored
   - Class `bbz-keyboard-visible` is removed
   - Page returns to original state

## Browser Compatibility

### Dynamic Viewport Height (`dvh`)

- ✅ Chrome 108+
- ✅ Safari 15.4+
- ✅ Firefox 101+
- ✅ Android WebView (modern versions)

### Fallback Strategy

For older browsers that don't support `dvh`:

- Uses `-webkit-fill-available` as fallback
- Dynamic padding still works via JavaScript
- Graceful degradation ensures basic functionality

### Visual Viewport API

- ✅ Chrome 61+
- ✅ Safari 13+
- ✅ Firefox 91+
- ⚠️ Fallback to `window.resize` for older browsers

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Keyboard Functionality

- [ ] Open schul.cloud in the app
- [ ] Navigate to a chat or text input at bottom of page
- [ ] Tap the input field
- [ ] Verify keyboard appears smoothly
- [ ] Verify input scrolls into view and stays visible
- [ ] Verify you can type without input being covered
- [ ] Dismiss keyboard
- [ ] Verify page returns to normal (no extra padding remains)

### Console Log Verification

Expected logs when focusing a bottom input:

```
[BBZCloud] 🎹 Keyboard handler v5.0 - Dynamic padding & viewport
[BBZCloud] 🎹 🚀 Initializing keyboard handler v5.0...
[BBZCloud] 🎹 ✅ Keyboard handler v5.0 initialized successfully
[BBZCloud] 🎹 🎯 Input FOCUSED - AGGRESSIVE MODE
[BBZCloud] 🎹 ✅ Keyboard SHOWN - Applied bottom padding { keyboardHeight: 456, paddingValue: 506 }
[BBZCloud] 🎹 🎯 Input is near BOTTOM of page - Dynamic padding should help
[BBZCloud] 🎹 ❌ Keyboard HIDDEN - Restored padding
```

### Edge Cases to Test

- [ ] Input at absolute bottom of page (< 100px from bottom)
- [ ] Multiple inputs in a form at bottom
- [ ] Switching between inputs while keyboard is visible
- [ ] Rotating device with keyboard open
- [ ] Keyboard appearance in landscape mode
- [ ] Apps with fixed headers/footers
- [ ] Apps with custom scrollable containers

## Advantages Over Previous Versions

### vs. v4.2 (Aggressive Multi-Method)

- ✅ Solves bottom-of-page inputs that couldn't be scrolled
- ✅ Creates actual scrollable space instead of just trying to scroll
- ✅ Cleaner solution with fewer scroll attempts
- ✅ Better logging for debugging

### vs. v2.0 (Event Bridge Attempt)

- ✅ No complex event bridging between MainActivity and InAppBrowser
- ✅ Pure WebView API solution (no native dependencies)
- ✅ Works within InAppBrowser constraints
- ✅ Maintainable and testable

## Known Limitations

1. **Padding Transition**

   - There's a 0.2s transition when padding is applied
   - Might be briefly visible on some pages
   - Can be adjusted via CSS if needed

2. **Original Padding Preservation**

   - Only stores padding once on initialization
   - If page dynamically changes body padding, it won't be reflected
   - Acceptable trade-off for cleaner code

3. **Browser Support**
   - Dynamic viewport units (`dvh`) require modern browsers
   - Fallback works but may not be as smooth
   - All supported browsers in Capacitor/Ionic work well

## Future Improvements (If Needed)

If this solution doesn't fully solve the issue, consider:

1. **Native Plugin Enhancement**

   - Request `@capgo/inappbrowser` to add native keyboard handling
   - Options like `adjustViewportForKeyboard: true`
   - Would be the most robust solution

2. **Container-Specific Padding**

   - Apply padding to specific containers instead of body
   - Better for complex layouts with multiple scroll areas

3. **Manual Height Calculation**
   - Calculate exact space needed for input
   - Apply only minimum necessary padding
   - More precise but more complex

## Migration from v4.2

No breaking changes! Version 5.0 builds on v4.2 by:

- Adding padding logic (non-breaking)
- Improving CSS with viewport units (enhancement)
- Keeping all existing scroll methods
- Maintaining same configuration structure

Simply replace the file and rebuild - no other changes needed.

## Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build the web app
npm run build

# Sync to native platforms
npx cap sync android

# Open in Android Studio for testing
npx cap open android

# Or run directly
npx cap run android
```
